# Report Copilot

Report Copilot is an AI-powered dashboard that lets users query structured data (customers, bookings, products, etc.) in plain English and automatically visualizes results in tables and charts.

## Flow

- User enters a question in plain English.
- Backend sends the question + DB schema to the OpenAI model.
- OpenAI returns a JSON query (SQL or Mongo filter) + description of data to display.
- Backend runs the query on your database.
- Results are sent to frontend for display in:
    ðŸ“Š a data table
    ðŸ“ˆ a dynamic chart (bar, line, pie, etc.)
